",Have you ever loaded a pre-trained machine learning model onto your system or computer that was shared by someone else or downloaded from the internet?,"Given this snippet of code, how comfortable would you feel when loading the shared model? ","If you feel that the previous situation raises any concerns, which one(s)?","Given this snippet of code, how comfortable would you feel when loading the shared model? ","If you feel that the previous situation raises any concerns, which one(s)?","Given this snippet of code, how comfortable would you feel when loading the shared model? ","If you feel that the previous situation raises any concerns, which one(s)?","Given this snippet of code, how comfortable would you feel when loading the shared model? 

Note: This question also includes the process of importing the model definition or code provided by the same source from which you downloaded the model weights.","If you feel that the previous situation raises any concerns, which one(s)?","Have you ever inspected a shared model file before loading it?

This means performing actions such as unzipping the file (if required by the format), understanding the files it contains, reviewing their contents, and evaluating the internals of the model before loading it into your system.","Knowing that platforms like Hugging Face provide security tools for their repositories, including malware scanning, pickle scanning, secrets scanning, and third-party AI model scanners such as JFrog and Protect AIâ€”if the shared model you were to load was downloaded from such platforms, would your perception of comfort in doing so change?","If you feel that the previous situation raises any concerns, which one(s)?"
