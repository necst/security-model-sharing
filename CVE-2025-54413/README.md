### Instructions for Reproducibility

Run the `run.sh` script inside the `docker` folder to start a container with the correct dependencies and library versions.
The script will automatically build the Docker image, start the container, and attach you to a bash shell inside it.

Once inside the container, run the Python PoC script. The PoC spawns a shell during model loading.
