## Summary

When using `Card.get_model`, `skops` allows for arbitrary code execution. Indeed, `Card.get_model` supports both `joblib` and `skops` for model loading. When loading `.skops` models, it uses `skops`' secure loading with trusted type validation, raising errors for untrusted types unless explicitly allowed. However, when non-`.zip` file formats are provided, the function silently falls back to `joblib` without warning. Unlike `skops`, `joblib` allows arbitrary code execution during loading, bypassing security measures and potentially enabling malicious code execution.

## Details

The `Card.get_model` function supports loading models using the `get_model` method. When a `.skops` model is provided, it uses the `load` function from `skops`, which includes secure mechanisms. The `Card` class also supports consistent management of the `trusted` list, which can be passed during instance creation. As expected, if a `.skops` model is provided without a `trusted` list and an untrusted type is encountered during loading, an error is raised. This behavior is consistent with the security principles of `skops`.

The problem arises when a file format other than `.zip` is provided. As shown in the code snippet below, in this case, the `joblib` library is then used to load the model. This happens **silently**, without any warning or indication that `joblib` is being used. This is a significant security risk because `joblib` does not enforce the same security measures as `skops`, allowing arbitrary code execution.

```python
# from `card/_model_card.py:354-358`
try:
    if zipfile.is_zipfile(model_path):
        model = load(model_path, trusted=trusted)
    else:
        model = joblib.load(model_path)
```

## Exploit

Consider the following example, where the model is loaded using `Card.get_model`:

```python
from skops.card import Card

card = Card("model.skops")
clf  = card.get_model()
```

An attacker could share a `model.skops` file that, despite its name, is **not** a `.zip` file. In this case, the `joblib.load` function is called, allowing arbitrary code execution if the file is actually a pickle-like object. This is difficult for the user to detect, as the check is based on the file’s format, not its extension or name.

This vulnerability exists regardless of the `trusted` list provided (or omitted) during `Card` instance creation, and is unaffected by any other parameters.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

A complete PoC is provided for reference and reproducibility.

The folder contains:

* `generate_evil_model.py` – generates a malicious `pickle` file named `model.skops`
* `poc.py` – demonstrates loading the malicious file

## Attack Scenario

An attacker can craft a malicious model file that, when loaded using `Card.get_model`, executes **arbitrary code** on the victim’s machine. This occurs **at load time** and requires no user interaction beyond loading the model. Given that `skops` is often used in collaborative environments and is designed with security in mind, this vulnerability poses a significant threat.
